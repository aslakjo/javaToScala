This is a project with a set of steps/tags for converting a Java application to a Scala application.

It it a basic Blog with User

It uses among other things SBT, JPA(eclipselink) and DerbyDB

check the tags out in this sequence:

* init 		- the inital tag (where to start;-)
* comment 	- Comment entity => Scala
* entry 	- Entry entity => Scala
* idpk 		- Adding IdPK trait
* blog 		- Blog entity => Scala
* user 		- User entity => Scala
* dao 		- All the daos with interfaces => Scala
* service 	- Service layer (it's not a very fancy layer but that is not the point) => Scala
* loggable	- Adding loggable trait to service instead of declaring it uses implicit Manifest
* cake		- Using cake pattern for "dependency injection"

Good luck!
